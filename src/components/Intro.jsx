                I am a student attending the Community College of Philadelphia seeking to obtain a career as a software engineer. 
                Recognized for demonstrating a natural aptitude for strategic planning and process improvement, I have a verifiable history of achieving maximum output and minimal expenditures. 
                Professional focal points include programming languages such as Python, Java, HTML & CSS. Delivering superior administration on the latter areas of expertise requires exceptional utilization of effective communication and organization skills.
